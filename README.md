- Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
    - The app I developed is an inventory management tool designed to address the specific needs of small to medium-sized businesses or individuals who require efficient tracking and management of their inventory. The primary goal was to create an app that simplifies inventory processes, enabling users to quickly add, delete, or modify inventory items, monitor stock levels, and receive alerts for low inventory. This app addresses the need for a streamlined, user-friendly, and accessible way to manage inventory data without complex or costly systems. 

- What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
    - The app features several key screens, including a main inventory list view, item addition/editing screens, and low inventory alerts. The UI is designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate, ensuring that users can perform tasks without being confused. User-centric design principles were applied by incorporating clear visual elements and straightforward navigation. The designs were successful because they prioritized ease of use and efficiency, which are critical for users managing inventory.
  
- How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
    - I focused on writing clean, maintainable, and modular code, ensuring each component of the app functioned independently yet worked seamlessly together. Techniques like version control, thorough commenting, and adherence to coding standards were important. There were a few times I broke my application and had to use version control to roll it back so I could continue. These practices are universally applicable and will be valuable in future projects for ensuring code quality and project manageability.

- How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
    - I did manual testing to check that everything functioned properly and I tested cases if a user forgot parts, such as inputting a product id, to ensure the app properly handled these scenarios. This process is vital as it uncovers functional and user experience issues, ensuring the app not only works technically but also meets user expectations.
 
- Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
    - Throughout the development process, I encountered and overcame several challenges, particularly in implementing the low inventory alert feature. I innovated by integrating local notifications and background processes, ensuring users receive timely updates. This required learning new aspects of Android development and applying creative problem-solving skills.
 
- In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
    - A particularly successful component of my app was the inventory alert system. This feature demonstrated my ability to integrate advanced functionality that goes beyond basic CRUD operations. It showcased my skills in handling background processes, local notifications, and user preferences.
